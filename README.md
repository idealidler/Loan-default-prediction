# Loan-default-prediction

Problem Statement:
To predict which bank customers will be a potential defaulter after applying for a loan

Goals and Implications:
1. Credit risks are caused by clients who are unable to pay, which can harm your organization.
2. A credit risk can result from:
 a. A small account with poor credit and the potential to go out of business
 b. A large account with high concentration that could make your business insolvent
3.The ultimate goal is to establish a borrower's creditworthiness by quantifying the risk of loss to which the lender is exposed.

Using this code, we can predict if the borrower is going to get default or not. 
The code also includes exploratory data analysis which provides insights about potential defaulters.


Libraries used:

pandas,
numpy,
seaborn,
